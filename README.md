Q2 is in whoami.js
the challange starts with download of whoami.zip that holds whoami.jpg.
file is actually a json file.

looking at the file i noticed unicode chars of hebrew letters.
structure is an array of gimatria numbers. i took the string and choped anything that is not a letter, converted the letters to numbers and calculated sum. that matches with the numbers in file.

now other thing i noticed is that there is a sentence hidden - return
in
base64
sum
of
values
below
median

tried that and it didn't work. to be continued..
